## Task #2​ (C++/Java)

Write a console application which has N producers (N=1…10), M consumers (M=1…10) and one data queue. Each producer and consumer is a separate thread and all threads are working concurrently. Producer thread sleeps 0…100 milliseconds randomly then it wakes up and generates a random number between 1 and 100 and then puts this number into the data queue.  Consumer thread sleeps 0…100 milliseconds randomly and then wakes up and takes the number from the queue and saves it to the output ‘data.txt’ file. All numbers are appended in the file and all they are comma delimited (for example 4,67,99,23,…). When a producer thread puts the next number to the data queue, it checks the size of the data queue, and if it is >=100 the producer thread is blocked until the number of elements gets <= 80. When a consumer thread wants to take the next number from the data queue and there are no elements in it, the consumer thread is blocked until a new element is added to the data queue by a producer.

When we start the application we need to insert the N (number of producers) and the M (number of consumers) after which the program starts all threads. It should print the current number of elements of the data queue every second. When we stop the program, it should interrupt all producers and wait for all consumers to save all queued data then program exits.
